## About the Coinvise bot

### Q: The Coinvise bot replied to my tipping command with "Invalid format"

1. Confirm that the format was correct:.
    - Tip command: `/tip token:henkaku network: Matic/Polygon user:@user_to_tip amount:10`
    - `@user_to_tip` is the Discord user to receive the tip
    - `10` is the amount of `$HENKAKU` that you want to give them
1. If the command's format was correct but you still got "Invalid format":
    - Send `/register 0x...` on the `#ðŸ’°â”‚tipping` channel again
    - `0x...` is your Ethereum address
1. `@Coinvise Bot#9566` will send you a DM with a link for you to complete verification using your wallet (at no ETH or MATIC cost)
1. Retry the tip command after doing so

## About Snapshot and proposals

### Q: My voting power is different from the amount of $HENKAKU on my address
- Voting power for a given proposal is the amount of $HENKAKU the voter held when the proposal was published. It is not relevant if at the time of voting the voter's $HENKAKU has increased.
